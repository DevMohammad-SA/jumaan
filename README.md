# Juman — ملتقى جُمان للفتيات

Read this in Arabic: [README.ar.md](README.ar.md)

Management platform for **Juman Girls' Forum** (ملتقى جُمان للفتيات), an
educational forum run by **Aisha bint Abi Bakr School for Quran
Memorization** (مدرسة عائشة بنت أبي بكر لتحفيظ القرآن), affiliated with the
**Jubail Charitable Society for Quran Memorization** (الجمعية الخيرية لتحفيظ
القرآن بالجبيل), for middle‑ and high‑school female students. Supervisors record daily and weekly attendance
(including a Quran circle) and a weekly task; participants earn a
triple‑currency reward and progress toward an "elite trip" nomination
(رحلة النخبة). The end‑user product is branded **جُمان** ("Juman").

The entire UI and domain language is **Arabic** (`ar-sa`, `Asia/Riyadh`,
right‑to‑left). This file is in English for GitHub; **[`README.ar.md`](README.ar.md) is the
Arabic version.** Detailed technical docs are in [`docs/`](docs/), and
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) tracks released versions.

## Overview

- Participants belong to a **class** (فصل / `Group`), which one or
  more group supervisors can be assigned to (`Group.supervisor` is a
  many‑to‑many field).
- As supervisors record attendance and review tasks, participants earn a
  triple currency, all converted together through one function,
  `apply_points_delta` (`participants/views.py`):

  | Currency | Field | Rule |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Points (النقاط) | `points` | Ranking currency. Resettable program‑wide (a snapshot is saved first). No longer shown as its own card on the participant dashboard, but still computed and used for the elite‑trip ranking. |
  | Miles (الأميال) | `miles` | `points_delta × 10`, applied together. Never reset. |
  | Purchase points (النقاط الشرائية) | `purchase_points` | Spent in the store. Never reset by the reset action; the store is the only feature that moves it directly, bypassing `apply_points_delta`. |

  All balances are clamped at zero.

- **Point sources** (values taken verbatim from `participants/views.py`):

  | Source | Points | Notes |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Weekly gathering | 8 (+2 early‑arrival bonus) | `MeetingAttendance` |
  | Quran circle | 3 attended + 2 achieved (independent) | `CircleAttendance` |
  | Weekly activity | 10 (flat, single attendance flag) | `WeeklyActivityAttendance` — new |
  | Weekly task acceptance | 10, or 12 if marked "featured" (⭐) | `TaskSubmission.is_featured` — new |
  | Manual extra points / deduction | −1000 to +1000, mandatory reason | `ExtraPointsView`, general supervisor/superadmin only — new |

  Every one of these (except the store) also writes an audit-log row to
  `PointsLedgerEntry`, viewable per‑group or program‑wide in the new
  **points ledger** (`participants:points_ledger`). Full details:
  [`docs/points-system.md`](docs/points-system.md).

## Roles

Defined in `accounts/models.py` (`Role`):

| Role | Arabic | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `participant` | مشاركة | Logs in with **national ID + password**. Personal dashboard (with an embedded points ledger and the elite‑trip indicator), weekly task upload, store. |
| `group_supervisor` | مشرفة فصل | Records weekly‑gathering, Quran‑circle, and weekly‑activity attendance for **their own class(es) only**; views their group's participant data and points ledger. |
| `general_supervisor` | مشرفة عامة | Program‑wide: Excel import, single‑participant add form, weekly tasks, store management, manual extra‑points grants, points reset, full points ledger, all classes. |
| `superadmin` | مشرفة النظام | Same permissions as general supervisor in every view, plus Django admin (`is_staff`/`is_superuser`). |

Full permission matrix: [`docs/roles-and-permissions.md`](docs/roles-and-permissions.md).

## Tech stack

From `pyproject.toml` (`requires-python = ">=3.12"`):

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) `>=6.0,<6.1`
- [django-unfold](https://unfoldadmin.com/) `>=0.104.1` — themed admin
- [django-environ](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/) `>=0.14` — `.env` settings
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/) `>=3.1.5` — Excel participant import
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) `>=12.3` — uploaded‑image compression
- [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) `>=70.0` — participant‑roster PDF export
- [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) `>=26.2.0` — production WSGI server (Docker deployment)
- [psycopg2-binary](https://www.psycopg.org/) `>=2.9.12` — PostgreSQL driver (Docker deployment)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — dependency & environment management
- **Chart.js 4** — loaded from CDN in the general‑supervisor dashboard only
- **Database:** **SQLite** (`db.sqlite3`) for local development (the
  default, unchanged); **PostgreSQL 16** in the Docker production setup
  (`USE_POSTGRES=True`). See [Deployment](#deployment).

## Local development

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies into a managed virtualenv
uv sync

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
#    edit .env — SECRET_KEY is required; DEBUG defaults to False

# 3. Apply migrations
uv run python manage.py migrate

# 4. Create an admin account (role is set to superadmin automatically)
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

# 5. Run the development server
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

- App: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>
- Admin: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/>

### Environment variables

Local development only needs the first two; the rest apply to the Docker
production setup (`.env.docker`, see [Deployment](#deployment)).

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | yes | — | Django secret key |
| `DEBUG` | no | `False` | Debug mode |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | no (prod: yes) | `[]` | Comma-separated allowed hosts |
| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | no (prod: yes) | `[]` | Comma-separated trusted HTTPS origins |
| `USE_POSTGRES` | no | `False` | `True` switches `DATABASES` to PostgreSQL |
| `DB_ENGINE` | no (prod: with `USE_POSTGRES`) | `django.db.backends.postgresql` | DB backend |
| `DB_NAME` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` / `DB_HOST` | with `USE_POSTGRES` | — | PostgreSQL connection |
| `DB_PORT` | no | `5432` | PostgreSQL port |
| `POSTGRES_DB` / `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | with Docker's `db` service | — | Read by the official `postgres` image itself on first run; must match `DB_NAME`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD` exactly (same values, different variable names — required by that image's own design). |

`.env`, `.env.docker`, `db.sqlite3`, and `media/` are gitignored.

### Common commands

```bash
uv run python manage.py makemigrations
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py check
uv run python manage.py test                 # full suite
uv run python manage.py test participants     # one app
```

`accounts/tests.py` and `participants/tests.py` contain real test coverage
(participant password flow, Quran circle point deltas, points‑reset
snapshot history, store management branches, PDF export role scoping) — they
are no longer empty stubs.

> **WeasyPrint note:** the PDF export endpoint (`/participants/data/export-pdf/`)
> needs the system libraries WeasyPrint depends on (Pango, Cairo, GObject).
> These are **installed inside the production Docker image** (`Dockerfile`),
> so PDF export works there; a local dev machine without them will only
> break this one endpoint (the import is lazy, inside the view, so the rest
> of the site is unaffected). `static/images/letterhead.png` (the official
> letterhead used as the PDF's page background) is present in the repo. See
> [`docs/known-limitations.md`](docs/known-limitations.md).

## Deployment

The repository ships a full Docker‑based production setup:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Dockerfile` | `python:3.12-slim` base, installs WeasyPrint's and psycopg2's native library dependencies, installs deps via `uv sync --frozen --no-dev`. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Four services: `db` (PostgreSQL 16), `web` (Gunicorn), `nginx` (reverse proxy + static/media serving), `certbot` (Let's Encrypt renewal every 12h). |
| `docker/entrypoint.sh` | Waits for PostgreSQL, runs `migrate` + `collectstatic`, then starts Gunicorn (3 workers, 120s timeout). |
| `docker/nginx/nginx.conf` | HTTP‑only bootstrap config, used before the first TLS certificate exists (serves the ACME HTTP‑01 challenge). |
| `docker/nginx/nginx-ssl.conf` | Full HTTPS config — activated manually after the first certificate is issued. |
| `docker/certbot-init.sh` | One‑time manual script to issue the first Let's Encrypt certificate. |
| `.env.docker.example` | Template production env file — copy to `.env.docker` and fill in real values before `docker compose up`. |

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
#    edit .env.docker with real SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DB credentials, etc.
docker compose up -d --build
#    first time only, once the stack is reachable over plain HTTP:
./docker/certbot-init.sh
#    then activate HTTPS:
cp docker/nginx/nginx-ssl.conf docker/nginx/nginx.conf
docker compose up -d --force-recreate nginx
```

Notes:
- TLS terminates at Nginx; Gunicorn only sees plain HTTP over the internal
  Docker network. `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` in `config/settings.py` trusts
  `X-Forwarded-Proto` from Nginx so Django's CSRF check doesn't reject HTTPS
  POSTs.
- Certificate renewal is automatic, but **Nginx is not reloaded
  automatically after a renewal** — see
  [`docs/known-limitations.md`](docs/known-limitations.md).
- Guides referenced as `دليل_رفع_الاستضافة.md` and `دليل_تحديث_الموقع.md`
  are still **not tracked in this repository**; if the project owner has
  them elsewhere, add them to `docs/` to make them an actual reference.

## Project layout

```
config/         Django project package (settings, urls, wsgi/asgi)
accounts/       Identity & authentication — custom User, Role, auth backend, middleware
participants/   Program data — Group, Participant, attendance (3 kinds), tasks, store, points ledger, dashboards
templates/      Shared templates (public home page)
static/         Logo, PDF letterhead, Tajawal font, and the Excel import template
docker/         Production deployment: entrypoint script, Nginx configs, certbot init script
docs/           Detailed technical documentation (Arabic)
```

Dependency direction is always `participants → accounts`, never the reverse.

## Documentation

Start with [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). Most important for anyone
picking up maintenance: **[`docs/known-limitations.md`](docs/known-limitations.md)**
— it now also has a dedicated section documenting exactly what has changed
since earlier reviews of this documentation, rather than silently dropping
those notes. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the release history.
